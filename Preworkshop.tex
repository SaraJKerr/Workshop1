\section*{Pre-workshop Preparation}
Before taking part in the workshop it would be very helpful if you could download \textbf{R} and \textbf{R Studio}, and install the packages that will be used in the workshop as this can take a little time. The programs are free and are available for both Mac and Windows. 

I have outlined the steps needed to download the programs and packages below.

\section{Loading R}
To download and install \textbf{R}: 

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Go to \textbf{\url{https://cran.r-project.org}} 
	\item Select the Mac or Windows download option on the R Download Page
	\item Follow the instructions in the sections below for your operating system
\end{enumerate}

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{downloadR.jpg}
	\caption{R Download Page}
\end{figure}

\subsection*{For Mac Users}
The following page should now be shown:

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{macR.jpg}
	\caption{R Download Page for Mac}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Download and install R}

The download you choose depends on the operating system running on your Mac. To find out your operating system click on the \textit{Apple icon} on your menu bar and select \textit{About This Mac}.

If you are running Mavericks (OS X 10.9) or higher click on the first link to download. Double click on the downloaded .pkg file and follow the installer instructions to download. This may take a few minutes.

If you are running Snow Leopard or Mountain Lion click on the second link - if this is the case, you will not need to download XQuartz.

\textbf{Check that R has downloaded correctly}

Go to \textit{Applications} and double click on the R icon and the page below should open:

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{rconsole.jpg}
	\caption{R Console}
\end{figure}

You can now close the R console.

If this does not work, try installing R again.

\textbf{Download and install XQuartz}

Once you have downloaded R you will also need to download the latest version of \textbf{XQuartz}. Click on the link on the R download page or go to \textbf{\url{https://www.xquartz.org}}. Follow the install instructions.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{xquartz.jpg}
	\caption{XQuartz Download Page}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Download Xcode and accept licence}

Finally, go to the App Store and download Xcode. 
 
Once it has been downloaded, go to \textit{Applications} and open Xcode by double clicking. You may be prompted to install additional elements, if so click \textit{install}. Open Xcode and accept licence. You can now close Xcode.

\subsection*{For Windows Users}
The following page should now be shown:

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{windowsR.jpg}
	\caption{R for Windows}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Download and install R}
Click on the link \textit{install R for the first time}. The following page will be shown:

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{windowsDL.jpg}
	\caption{R  Download Page for Windows}
\end{figure}

Click on the link \textit{Download R 3.3.2. for Windows}. Once the .exe file has downloaded, double click on it and follow the installation instructions. 

For a video tutorial walk through of the download process see: \url{https://youtu.be/maQJMgQkqoE}.

\textbf{Check that R has downloaded correctly}

Open R - a page similar to the page below should open:

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{rconsole.jpg}
	\caption{R Console}
\end{figure}

You can now close the R console.

If this does not work, try installing R again.

\section{Loading `R Studio'}
Although R can be used directly, it is easier to use it via an integrated development environment (IDE). One of the most popular IDEs for R is \textbf{R Studio}. R Studio is made up of four main panes which allow simultaneous access to the console, document editor, environment and help.
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{rstudiopanes.jpg}
	\caption{The R Studio Panes}
\end{figure}

R Studio can be downloaded by going to \textbf{\url{https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/}}. Scroll down the page until you reach the heading \textit{Installers for Supported Platforms}, then select the option for your operating system. 

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{rstudio.jpg}
	\caption{R Studio Download Page}
\end{figure}

The downloaded file will be .dmg for Mac or .exe for Windows. Double click and follow the installer instructions.

Check that R Studio has downloaded correctly by opening the program.

\textbf{Updates:} From time to time both R and R Studio are updated. This can have an impact on how packages work, especially if you are running an outdated version of R. Make sure you check for updates every 3--6 months.

\section{Loading the packages for the workshop}
R is set up with \textbf{`base' R} which includes a variety of functions and built in data sets. To improve the funtionality of R there is an increasingly broad range of packages available for specific uses. These can be easily added to R as needed. The majority of packages (almost 10000) are available via \textbf{\url{https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/}}.

There are two ways to add packages to R in R Studio, the first is by using the \textit{Tools - Install Packages} option in the top menu in R Studio.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{installPkg.jpg}
	\caption{R Studio Install Packages}
\end{figure}

You will need to write the name of each package you wish to download separated by a comma or space. However, this will only work for packages which are available from the CRAN website.

You will need to install the following R packages for the workshop: "tm", "RColorBrewer", "ggplot2", "wordcloud", "tsne", "Rtsne", "devtools", "stringi", "ggrepel" and "wordVectors".

Run the following piece of code in the R Console to install the packages required for the workshop: 

\begin{minted}[linenos]{r} 
# Create a vector of the required packages available from CRAN 
needed <- c("tm", "RColorBrewer", "ggplot2", "wordcloud", "tsne", 
                   "Rtsne", "devtools", "stringi", "ggrepel")

# install the packages to your laptop
install.packages(needed)

# install the wordVectors package from GitHub
library(devtools)
install_github("bmschmidt/wordVectors")

\end{minted}

It may take a little time for all the packages to install. Once this has been done, and the command prompt \textbf{\textgreater} is showing, you can close R.



\section{Learning `R'}
During the workshop you will be given all the code you need to carry out the analysis. 

If you wish to get an overview of how R works and familiarize yourself with some of the commands \textbf{\url{https://www.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r}} or \textbf{\url{http://tryr.codeschool.com}} give a brief practical introduction.
